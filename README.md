# ${1:browsMS}

On the basic level, browsms allows users to browse the web in a stripped down all text environment. The user can submit 
a url as an sms message, all the processing is done on the backend, and the server returns a pure text representation 
of the webpage. Pure SMS for the end user!

## Installation

More info coming soon! We need to make some improvements/get a full twilio license, and then we can hopefully 
release browsms to the world! 

## Usage

The service is accessed entierly through SMS for the end user, no data required
